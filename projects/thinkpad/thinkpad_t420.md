Thinkpad T420

Corebot and buy a i7-3840QM or a i7-3740Qm. The 3840 is the fastest CPU I would feel comfortable going to. The 3740 is probably the best value of all of your options. You should be able to get it for 75$.
Plus you should note that getting a 3rd gen processor with Intel 4000 HD graphics is 50% faster than the Nvidia graphics that came with the T420. This is perhaps your most significant upgrade. I would recommend doing core boot for this alone. Disable the dGPU and run with the 3rd gen Quad core and Intell 4000.
