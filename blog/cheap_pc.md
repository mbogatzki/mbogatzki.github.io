Monitor for a PC:
- the monitor was choosen and bought by my dad

- there was one fix attempt, by replacing the electrolit capicitors (31,99zł), but no result
- second was a Phillips 24" LED FHD monitor with speakers and camera (109zł) and it works, but sound wasn't sent by HDMI, so we had to buy mini-jack cable (19,89zł)
